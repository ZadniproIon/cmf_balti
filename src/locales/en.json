      "text": "The health system in mun. Bălți until 1997 consisted of 13 medical institutions; the outpatient sector was represented by 3 polyclinics for adults and 2 polyclinics for children, including narrow-profile specialists, specialized dispensaries and 2 consultation centers for women.\n\nWith the adoption of the Concept for the development of the health system in the Republic of Moldova for the period 1997-2005 (Government Decision of the Republic of Moldova No. 668 of 17.07.97), in accordance with the provisions of Government Decision No. I134 of 09.12.97 \"On the development of primary medical care\", in order to accelerate the reform of the health system and implement measures for the transition to a new form of primary medical care, the local public administration bodies took a number of important decisions in this context.\n\nIn February 1998, a Territorial Medical Association was established in the municipality, initially named \"Association of Polyclinics of mun. Bălți\". The new medical institution was formed by merging the adult/children polyclinics and the consultation centers for women, with the purpose of providing primary medical care to the population of the municipality.\n\nFrom 01.03.98, through the reorganization of these structures, 5 mixed polyclinics were created; later, the specialists were united in a consultative-diagnostic section. Initially, doctors worked in large teams composed of 3 therapists, 2 pediatricians and 1 obstetrician-gynecologist. Starting in 2000, the teams were reduced to 3 doctors, one of whom, obligatorily, was a former pediatrician, a move aimed primarily at ensuring high-quality medical care for young children and increasing the responsibility of each doctor.\n\nAs a result of the administrative-territorial reform, by order of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Moldova No. I60 of 01.07.99, the new health system of the municipality of Bălți was approved. Based on the \"Association of Polyclinics\", the \"Municipal Center of Family Doctors Bălți\" was formed, with the withdrawal of narrow-profile specialists to the consultative section of the District Hospital.\n\nThe structure of the health system of the municipality of Bălți did not undergo significant changes even after the new administrative-territorial reform; in December 2003 the Public Medical-Sanitary Institution \"Municipal Center of Family Doctors Bălți\" was established, which has as subdivisions: 6 Health Centers and 2 OMFs - the Family Doctor's Office Sadovoe and the Family Doctor's Office Elizaveta, serving the population of the 81 sectors."

The mandatory health insurance system offers citizens equal opportunities to obtain timely and quality medical care.",
